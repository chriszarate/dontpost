				On the Internet we often find ourselves staring at a box. We type our thoughts into this box and hit
				<span class="button-post button-inline">Post</span>, and in an instant we see them reflected back at
				us. In many ways, this is the quintessential Internet activity—or, put another way,
				<span class="button-post button-inline">Post</span>ing helps answer the
				<a href="http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html">the fundamental question of the Web</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But what about the times when we <span class="button-post">Post</span> too quickly or without care? Or
				when it only feeds our feelings of disconnection or emptiness? Or when it distracts from more humane forms
				of communication? Have we <em>overoptimized</em> the Web for <span class="button-post">Post</span>?
			</p>
			<p>
				What if we had an explicit option of <span class="button-post button-inline button-dont">Don’t Post</span>?
				Could it provide an escape hatch to avoid our bad habits? Or perhaps a simple visual reminder of choice
				would help us <span class="button-post">Post</span> better?
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s find out.

			<h3>Wait, so what is this thing? And what does it do?</h3>
			<p>
				Don’t Post is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that adds “Don’t Post” (or “Don’t Tweet” or “Don’t
				Reply”) buttons to Facebook, Twitter, and other sites. Like this:

			<h3>I clicked the button. What happened to my post?</h3>
			<p>Nothing. Well, <em>something</em>. Imagine you closed the tab and walked away from your computer. It’s like that.</p>

			<h3>What else does it do?</h3>
			<p>Not a darn thing.</p>

			<h3>Uh, I clicked the button by mistake. Can I recover my post?</h3>
			<p>Nope. Sit this one out.</p>

			<h3>Does this work with the Facebook or Twitter app?</h3>
			<p>No, but there’s an easy workaround: Delete the app from your phone, then use the Web instead. <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/12/27/browser-bar-url-facebook-bad/">Browse with intent.</a></p>

			<h3>I found your Twitter page and you are a boring idiot.</h3>
			<p>Yup, that’s why I made this.</p>

			<h3>Do you collect any of my information or posts?</h3>
			<p>No. <a href="https://github.com/chriszarate/dontpost">Here’s the source code.</a></p>
